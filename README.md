# Neural Network Controller for Pacman Optimzied with Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains research code which explored the possibility of using a Genetic Algorithm as the optimization procedure to train a neural network controller for Pacman. Specifically, these experiments build off the code provided by [Berkeley's CS188 course](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html).

Our work extends the initial offerings from the CS188 codebase by adding a neural controller which can be trained to play the Pacman game in varying environments. We took this a step further by developing our own map layouts to test hypotheses and new developments. 

This research was my first experience working with Evolutionary Algorithms of any kind, and taught me a ton about neural controllers, optimization, local minima traps, and research in general. I hope this work can inspire students in a similar position, looking to explore Evolutionary methods and potentially extend work they've already completed for CS188 or associated courses.
